```clj-ravendb``` is available from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/clj-ravendb)

#

Add the following to ```project.clj``` ```:dependencies```:

## Usage

```clojure

(:require [clj-ravendb.client :refer :all]))

```

Getting a RavenDB client:

```clojure

(def northwind (client "http://localhost:8080" "northwind"))

```

Loading some documents:

```clojure
(load-documents northwind ["employees/1" "employees/2"])

```

Returns a map with a sequence of results like:

```clojure

{:status 200,
 :results
 ({:id "employees/1",
   :last-modified-date "2013-11-12T14:48:11.2943076Z",
   :etag "01000000-0000-0001-0000-00000000006A",
   :document
   {:Territories ["06897" "19713"],
    :HomePhone "(206) 555-9857",
    :ReportsTo "employees/1",

```

Putting a document:

```clojure

(put-document! northwind "Employees/10" { :FirstName "David" :LastName "Smith" :age 50 })

```

Returns a map with a key to indicate the HTTP status:

```clojure

{:status 200}

```

Deleting a document:

```clojure
(bulk-operations! northwind [{:method "DELETE"
                              :id "Key1"}])
```

Returns a map with a key to indicate the HTTP status:

```clojure

{:status 200}

```

Querying an index:

```clojure

(query-index northwind { :index "ByCompany" :Count 10 })

;; By default if the index is stale (query-index) will retry 5 times, waiting
;; 100 milliseconds between each try.

;; If the index is stale retry a maximum of 10 times.
(query-index northwind { :index "ByCompany" :Count 10 } { :max-attempts 10 })

;; If the index is stale retry every 500 milliseconds.
(query-index northwind { :index "ByCompany" :Count 10 } { :wait 500 })

```

Returns a map with a sequence of results like:

```clojure
{:status 200,
 :stale? false,
 :results
 ({:Company "companies/38", :Count 10.0, :Total 6146.3}
  {:Company "companies/49", :Count 10.0, :Total 7176.215}
  {:Company "companies/11", :Count 10.0, :Total 6089.9}
  {:Company "companies/30", :Count 10.0, :Total 11446.36}
  {:Company "companies/84", :Count 10.0, :Total 9182.43}
  {:Company "companies/56", :Count 10.0, :Total 12496.2}
  {:Company "companies/55", :Count 10.0, :Total 15177.4625}
  {:Company "companies/86", :Count 10.0, :Total 9588.425}
  {:Company "companies/59", :Count 10.0, :Total 23128.86}
  {:Company "companies/68", :Count 10.0, :Total 19343.779}
  {:Company "companies/80", :Count 10.0, :Total 10812.15})}

```

Creating an index:

```clojure
(put-index! northwind {:name "DocumentsByName"
                       :alias "doc"
                       :where "doc.name ==\"Test\""
                       :select "new { doc.name }"})
```

Returns a map with a key to indicate the HTTP status:

```clojure

{:status 200}

```

Watching for document changes:

```clojure
;; Watching documents makes use of core.async channels.
;; You can either pass in a channel or have watch-documents create one.
;; It creates a future that continuosly calls load-document and monitors
;; the results, each time they are different they are put on the channel.
(def watcher (watch-document northwind ["Companies/80", "Companies/79"]))
(let [ch (chan)]
 (def watcher (watch-documents northwind ["Companies/80","Companies/79"] ch)))

;; You can optionally tell the watcher to wait x milliseconds between 'checks'.
(def watcher (watch-documents northwind ["Companies/80","Companies/79"] ch {:wait 1000}))

;; If you dont pass in a channel, you can access the newly created one
(let [ch (:channel watcher)])

;; You can take from the channel like so
(def change (<!! ch))

;; Or non-blocking in a go block
(go (<! ch))

;; You can stop watching using :stop, this will close the channel and stop
;; the future
((:stop watcher))

```

Watching for index changes:

```clojure
;; Watching documents makes use of core.async channels.
;; You can either pass in a channel or have watch-documents create one.
;; It creates a future that continuosly calls load-document and monitors
;; the results, each time they are different they are put on the channel.
(def watcher (watch-index northwind {:index "SomeIndexToWatch"}))

(let [ch (chan)]
 (def watcher (watch-index northwind {:index "SomeIndexToWatch"} ch)))

;; You can optionally tell the watcher to wait x milliseconds between 'checks'.
(def watcher (watch-index northwind {: index "SomeIndexToWatch"} ch {:wait 1000}))

;; If you dont pass in a channel, you can access the newly created one
(let [ch (:channel watcher)])

;; You can take from the channel like so
(def change (<!! ch))

;; Or non-blocking in a go block
(go (<! ch))

;; You can stop watching using :stop, this will close the channel and stop
;; the future
((:stop watcher))

```

## Options

There are a number of "configuration" options that can be used when creating a client:

### Caching

To create a client that supports caching:

```clojure

(def northwind (client "http://localhost:8080" "northwind" {:caching? true}))

```

When this option is used documents loaded using `load-documents` will be cached. `put-document!` and `bulk-operations!` will update this local cache as well as the server.

###  Replication

To create a client that supports replication:

```clojure

(def northwind (client "http://localhost:8080" "northwind" {:replicated? true}))

```

When this option is used creating the client will also query the master url for replication destinations. The client will be represented by a map that looks like:

```clojure

{
  :replicated? true
  :master-only-write? true
  :address "http://localhost:8080"
  :replications ("http://localhost:8081" "http://localhost:8082")
}

```

When this client is used to `load-documents` or `query-index` if the master is down then one of the replications will be used.

###  Master Only Write

If you've created a client that supports replication by default write operations will only go to the master, you can change this behaviour using the following:

```clojure

(def northwind (client "http://localhost:8080" "northwind" {:replicated? true :master-only-write? false}))

```

The client will be represented by a map that looks like:

```clojure

{
  :replicated? true
  :master-only-write? false
  :address "http://localhost:8080"
  :replications ("http://localhost:8081" "http://localhost:8082")
}

```

When this client is used to `put-document!`, `put-index!` or for `bulk-operations!` if the master is down then one of the replications will be used for write operations.

## Build & Test

```
lein test
```

The tests for this project assume an instance of RavenDB is running at http://localhost:8080. They also assume that the instance contains the sample northwind database. The sample northwind database is available [here](https://github.com/ayende/ravendb/blob/2.5/Raven.Studio/Assets/EmbeddedData/Northwind.dump)
